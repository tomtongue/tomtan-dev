# tomtana.com
This is my portfolio built with [Docusaurus 2.0.1)](https://docusaurus.io/docs) and hosted on Vercel.

## How to create a project
Run the following command and apply the facebook theme.

```
$ npx create-docusaurus@latest tomtana-com facebook
```

As of writing this README, it's not possible to use `--package-manager yarn` option.

## How to develop the site
Run the following command and then the local server will be setup. You can see the pace by access localhost with 3000 port number.

```
$ npm start

> tomtana-com@<VERSION> start
> docusaurus start

[INFO] Starting the development server...
[SUCCESS] Docusaurus website is running at http://localhost:3000/.
